# About

**Reed feedback INOP!**

Custom Raspberry Pi Add-on board used for launching the [Galactic Aztec] rocket. The board was designed to be stackable with other add-on boards via the designated [pin configuration].

The Camera Control ethernet port was designed to activate [HackHD] cameras via the [Galactic Aztec Camera Control] (rev2 or newer) board and can be configured to activate multiple [HackHD]s using the [Galactic Aztec Camera Control Splitter] board.

The Valve Feedback ethernet port was designed to read valve actuation status (open or close) by means of reading Reed switches (for the Main, LOX and Kerosene valves) via the [Galactic Aztec Reed Switch Interface] and [Galactic Aztec Reed Switch Splitter] boards.

Custom EagleCAD parts on this board can be found in the [SDSU Rocket Eagle Libraries].
